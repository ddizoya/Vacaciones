# Vacaciones

This is a personal project.

It's intended to be an application where users can apply and notify Human Resources people the holidays
we want to reserve.

This is just made with Spring Boot 1.5.10 self learning puspose. 

Key concepts I'm learning:

 --> Spring Data: JpaRepository interface.
 
 --> Spring Security & Config: Authentication and Password encoder.
